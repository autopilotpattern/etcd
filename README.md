This repo is a demonstration of [etcd](https://coreos.com/etcd/docs/latest/) designed for self-operation according to the [Autopilot pattern](http://autopilotpattern.io/).

An etcd cluster needs an external source of data for all the nodes to find each other initially. This can be a bootstrap service (another etcd cluster) or an SRV record. Triton CNS does not yet support SRV records, so until it does we're standing up a temporary single-node cluster to bootstrap the cluster. After the cluster is scaled-up we can remove the bootstrap node.


## Getting started

1. [Get a Joyent account](https://my.joyent.com/landing/signup/) and [add your SSH key](https://docs.joyent.com/public-cloud/getting-started).
1. Install the [Docker Toolbox](https://docs.docker.com/installation/mac/) (including `docker` and `docker-compose`) on your laptop or other environment.
1. Install the [Triton Docker CLI](https://github.com/joyent/triton-docker-cli) when utilizing this pattern on Triton as well. This provides both `triton-docker` and `triton-compose`.
1. Install the the [Joyent Triton CLI](https://docs.joyent.com/public-cloud/api-access/cloudapi) (`triton` replaces our old `sdc-*` CLI tools) and set up your Triton profile.

At this point you're ready to start the cluster. A script `./start.sh` has been provided. It detects your deployment options, either Triton or local Docker, and uses Docker Compose to create each node. An initial bootstrap node is created along with a discovery token (see the [etcd docs on cluster discovery](https://coreos.com/os/docs/latest/cluster-discovery.html) for details) before the cluster can be scaled up. You can pass an environment variable `SCALE` to the `./start.sh` script to set the cluster size to something other than the default 3 nodes.

### Starting

```sh
$ ./start.sh

```


## Stopping

```sh
$ COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=e docker-compose -f local-compose.yml stop
Stopping e_etcd_1 ... done
Stopping e_etcd_2 ... done
Stopping e_etcd_3 ... done
```

You can also run the previous example with `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=e triton-compose stop`.
